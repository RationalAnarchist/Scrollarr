## High Priority Contenders (Similar Technical Structure)

These sites share the XenForo platform with the existing `QuestionableQuesting` source, making integration potentially easier.

### ~~1. SpaceBattles (spacebattles.com)~~
*   ~~**Description:** A large forum community with a heavy focus on science fiction, fanfiction, and original fiction.~~
*   ~~**Why it's a good fit:** Very similar to Questionable Questing in structure (XenForo). Often cross-posts with Sufficient Velocity and AO3. Has a dedicated Creative Writing section.~~
*   ~~**Technical Feasibility:** High. Can leverage the existing `QuestionableQuestingSource` logic for threadmarks and post extraction.~~

### ~~2. Sufficient Velocity (sufficientvelocity.com)~~
*   ~~**Description:** A forum that split from SpaceBattles, sharing a similar community and focus on sci-fi and fanfiction.~~
*   ~~**Why it's a good fit:** Almost identical structure to SpaceBattles and Questionable Questing (XenForo). Many authors post on both SB and SV.~~
*   ~~**Technical Feasibility:** High. Same codebase as SB/QQ.~~

## Strong Contenders (Similar Content/Audience)

### ~~3. Scribble Hub (scribblehub.com)~~
*   ~~**Description:** A platform for original web novels, often focusing on LitRPG, Isekai, and Progression Fantasy.~~
*   ~~**Why it's a good fit:** Structurally and thematically very similar to Royal Road. It was created by the same developer as Royal Road (or is heavily inspired by it).~~

*   ~~**Description:** The classic archive for fanfiction. Huge database of stories.~~
*   ~~**Why it's a good fit:** A staple of the fanfiction community. Many older stories are exclusive here.~~
